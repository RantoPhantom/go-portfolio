## I want to make this the first ever complete project :D
# This is just a simple to do list webapp made with golang + raw html and css and maybe some js

## Might implement more pages and turn this into an aggregate of projects, may be a terrible idea :D


# To do

## IMPORTANT
- [x] add db
- [ ] add caching for the item list (lol cannot do this)
- [x] add PUT op
- [ ] add DELETE op
- [ ] add time to the items
- [ ] add archive
- [ ] deploy it with docker
- [ ] ACTUALLY USE IT

## less important
- [ ] add reorganizing feature
- [ ] add notification functionality
